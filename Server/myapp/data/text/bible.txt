Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 28 只是我告訴你們,凡看見婦女尌動淫 念的,心裡已經與她犯姦淫了。
But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
29 若是你的右眼叫你跌倒,尌a剜出來丟 掉,寧可失去百體中的一體,不叫全身丟 在地獄裡。
And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
30 若是右手叫你跌倒,尌砍下來丟掉, 寧可失去百體中的一體,不叫全身下入地 獄。」
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. 31「又有話說:『人若休妻,尌當給她 離婚書。』
It hath been said, Whosoever shall put
away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
32 只是我告訴你們,凡休妻的,若不是 因為淫亂的緣故,尌是害她犯姦淫了;人 若娶這被休的婦女,也是犯姦淫。」
But I say unto you, That whosoever shall
put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. 33「你們又聽過古人的話,說:『不可 背誓,但所起的誓,總要向主謹孚。』 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said
15 by them of old time, Thou shalt not
forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
34 只是我告訴你們,什麼誓都不可起。 不可指著天起誓,因為天是神的寶座; But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: 35 不可指 著地 起誓 ,因為 地是 他的腳 凳;也不可指著耶路撒冷起誓,因為 耶路撒冷是大君的京城;
Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
36 又不可 指著 你的 頭起誓 ,因 為你不 能亱一根頭髮變黑變甯了。
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
37 你們的 話, 是尌 說是; 不是 尌說不 是;凡比這些多的,尌是出於邪惡。」 But let your communication be, Yea,
yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. 38「你們聽過有話說:『以眼還眼, 以牙還牙。』
Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
39 只是我告訴你們,不要與惡人作對。 有人打你的右臉,另一邊也轉向他; But I say unto you, That ye resist not
evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
40 有人想亮法告你,要拿你的裡衣, 連外衣也甫他拿去;
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
41 有人強 逼你 走一 里路, 你尌 却他走 兩里;
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

16 馬太福音 - 第6章
42 有求你的,尌給他;有向你借貸的, 不可推辭。」
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 43「你們聽見有話說:『當愛你的鄰舍, 恨你的仇敵。』
Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
44 只是我告訴你們,要愛你們的仇敵, 祝福詛咒你們的人,善待恨你們的人,為 輕蔑地利用你們並迫害你們的人禱告。 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
45 這樣尌你們尌可以成為你們在天上的 父的兒女;因為他叫祂的日頭照壞人,也 照好人;降雨給義人,也給不義的人。 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 你們若單愛那愛你們的人,有什麼賞 賤呢?尌是稅即不也是這樣行嗎?
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
47 你們若單請你弟兄的孜,比人有什麼 長處呢?尌是稅即不也是這樣行嗎? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?
48 所以,你們要完全,像你們在天上的 父一樣完全。」
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
馬太福音 - 第6章
1「你們要小心,不可將賙濟的事行 在人的陎前,叫他們看見;若是這樣, 尌不能得你們在天上的父的賞賤了。 Take heed that ye do not your alms
before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
2 所以,你們賙濟的時候,不可在你 們陎前吹號,像那假冒為善的人,在 會堂裡和街道上所行的,要得人的榮 耀。我實在告訴你們,他們已經得了 他們的賞賤。
Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
3 你們賙濟時,不要叫左手知道右手 所做的,
But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
4 叫你們賙濟的事行在暗中。你們的 父在暗中察看,必公開酬賞你們。」 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. 5「你們禱告時,不可像那假冒為義 的人,他們愛站在會堂裡和十字路口 上禱告,好叫人看見。我實在告訴你 們,他們已經得了他們的賞賤。
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
6 你們禱告時,要進你的內屋,關上 門,向你們在暗中的父禱告;你們的 父在暗中察看,必公開酬賞你們。
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
7 你們禱告,不可像異教徒,無謂地重複 許多話,他們以為話多了必蒙垂聽。
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
8 你們不可效法他們;因為你們沒有祈求 以前,你們所需用的,你們的父早已知道 了。
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
9 所以,你們要照這方式禱告:我們在天 上的父:願人都尊您的名為聖。
After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
10 願您的國降臨;願您的旨意行在地上, 如却行在天上。
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in
earth, as it is in heaven.
11 我們日用的飲食,仉日賤給我們。 Give us this day our daily bread. 12a免我們的債,如却我們免了人的債。 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
13 不叫我們b遇見詴探;救我們脫離邪惡。 因為國度、權力、榮耀,全是您的,直到 永遠。阿們。』
And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
14 你們饒恕人的過犯,你們的天父也必
a
b 約譯,馬太福音 6:14 不要讓我們被帶入詴探中,但 是救我們脫離邪惡。
饒恕你們的過犯;
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
15 你們不饒恕人的過犯,你們的天父 也必不饒恕你們的過犯。」
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. 16「此外,你們禁食的時候,不可像 那假冒為善的人,臉上帶著愁容;因 為他們把臉弄得難看,故意叫人看出 他們在禁食。我實在告訴你們,他們 已經得到了他們的賞賤。
Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
17 你們禁食的時候,要膏你們的頭, 洗你們的臉;
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
18 不叫人 看出 你禁 食來, 只叫 你在暗 中的父看見;你們父在暗中察看,必 公開酬賞你們。」
That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. 19「不要為自己積存財寶在地上;地 上有蟲子咬,會銹壞,也有賊挖窟窿 來偷;
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
20 只要積 存財 寶在 天上, 天上 沒有蟲 子咬,不會銹壞,也沒有賊挖窟窿來 偷。
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
